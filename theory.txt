Typically you'll write a at-least one test using "good" data which you expect to
pass, and another test using "bad" data which you expect to fail. what if
instead you wrote a single test-case which is fed "generated" data, which has
the ability to pass or fail at random, and you design the test to verify
whatever the outcome is, leaving the test only fail on exceptions.
