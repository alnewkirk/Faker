DESCRIPTION
    Faker is a Perl library that generates fake data for you. Whether you
    need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents,
    fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from
    a production service, Faker makes it easy to generate fake data with
    some semantics. Note: This is an early release available for testing and
    feedback and as such is subject to change.

ATTRIBUTES
  locale
        $faker->locale('en_US');
        my $locale = $faker->locale;

    The locale attribute helps the provider method find localized providers.

  namespace
        $faker->namespace('MyApp::Faker');
        my $namespace = $faker->namespace;

    The namespace attribute helps the provider method find user-defined
    and/or localized providers.

  providers
        $faker->providers({});
        my $providers = $faker->providers;

    The providers attribute contains a dispatch table implemented using a
    hashref where where the keys are provider short-names and values are the
    corresponding provider objects.

METHODS
  provider
        my $provider = $faker->provider('Author');
        # tries Faker::Provider::en_US::Author
        # tries Faker::Provider::Author

        $faker->namespace('MyApp::Faker')
        $faker->locale('en_US')
        # also tries MyApp::Faker::en_US::Author
        # also tries MyApp::Faker::Author

    The provider method, using the namespace and locale attributes, attempts
    to find, instantiate, cache, and return a provider object.
