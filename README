NAME
    Faker - Extensible Fake Data Generator

VERSION
    version 0.10

DESCRIPTION
    Faker is a Perl library that generates fake data for you. Whether you
    need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents,
    fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from
    a production service, Faker makes it easy to generate fake data with
    some semantics. Note: This is an early release available for testing and
    feedback and as such is subject to change.

SYNPOSIS
        use Faker;

        my $faker = Faker->new(locale => 'en_US');
        my $address = $faker->provider('Address');

        my $address_line1 = $address->line1;
        my $address_line2 = $address->line2;
        my $address_city  = $address->city_name;
        my $address_state = $address->state_abbr;
        my $address_zip   = $address->postal_code;

        say $address_line1;
        say $address_line2;
        say "$address_city, $address_state $address_zip";

        my $latitude  = $address->latitude;
        my $longitude = $address->longitude;

        say "$longitude, $latitude";

        my $person = $faker->provider('Person');

        say $person->name; # Adaline Reichel
        say $person->name; # Dr. Santa Prosacco DVM
        say $person->name; # Noemy Vandervort V
        say $person->name; # Lexi O'Conner
